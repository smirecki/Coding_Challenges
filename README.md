Coding_Challenges
=================
<<<<<<< HEAD

A collection of easy to difficult coding problems and solutions in PHP and JavaScript.

This is mostly for myself, but if you find this repository please use it as a learning 
tool and not as a place to plagiarise from ( you will make me cry ).  I wrote the 
majority of this code, with a few small parts borrowed from PHP Man.'s comment section 
and perhaps stackoverflow.
